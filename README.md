# Play Avabranch Game

## Avabranch
Avabranch is a fun side-scrolling game that gives players control of two intertwined branches to navigate obstacles. The core mechanic centers around the branches that the player can move either together or separately, creating a complex and engaging gameplay experience. As the map scrolls by, players need to quickly adapt to an array of obstacles, zigging and zagging the branches to avoid barriers in order to survive.

The art of Avabranch is in the mastery of its controls; coordinating the movements of both branches simultaneously demands dexterity, strategy and fast reflexes. The game increases in difficulty as the game progresses and obstacles become more intricate and unpredictable.  Do you think you can beat the game?

## Setup the Game
To play this game, we will use a pre-made game image deployed on Acorn.  Acorn is a cloud based platform that makes it easy to deploy applications.  With Acorn, everything about the deployment is contained in one image which can be anything from a single container game to a large multi service application.

To deploy we created a free account on https://acorn.io.  Then we simply clicked "Deploy Acorn" > "From Acorn Image" on the dashboard.  For the Acorn Image enter "ghcr.io/randall-coding/acorn/avabranch".  You can deploy your own server using the same method.
